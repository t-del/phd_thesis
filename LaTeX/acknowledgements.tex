\textbf{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}\\
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\end{centering}

I owe substantial thanks and gratitude to my two thesis advisors, Jason Amini and Ken Brown, without whom I would never have seen the far side of my doctorate. Much more could be said of their support, patience, and imparted knowledge than would reasonably fit here in the preamble, but suffice to say I couldn't have asked for better mentors. Many thanks as well to Bob Wyllie, who took on a similar role during my final year. 

I am indebted to the whole of the Quantum Systems lab at GTRI for giving me the opportunity and resources to conduct all of the research presented here. It was a pleasure to have been part of the lab for the last 4 years. I'd like to especially thank Bob Wylie, Brian Sawyer, Brian McMahon, True Merrill, and Wade Rellergert for their ongoing help and dissemination of knowledge. 

Finally, I would like to thank Elena for all of her love and support throughout this final leg.
